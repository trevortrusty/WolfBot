# WolfBot
I'm a discord bot that runs Mathematica/Wolfram code and sends you the result quickly!

> Currently, we are not releasing the bot invitation here yet while we are still in development, but to learn more or use WolfBot, head over to our server: [WolfBot Discord Server](https://discord.gg/eyd376A)

Features include:
- Functions of complex variables
- Easy to learn and use syntax and functions

My four current discord commands are
- .bark (***Takes in Wolfram code from you to be evaluated***)
- .alpha (***Mathematica tool that queries Wolfram|Alpha. It doesn't do everything that Wolfram|Alpha can do, it's a very minimal feature of WolfBot***)
- .help (***Sends a message regarding the bot info, and the commands listed here with their syntax***)
- .docs (***Searches the Wolfram Language Documentation for you***)

## Using WolfBot
  WolfBot relies on the Wolfram programming language and its syntax for input.
  
__**Bark Command**__
- Plot the graph of `E^x` from 0 to 5:
```
.bark Plot[E^x, {x, 0, 5}]
```
- Define a function `Sin[x]`, then graph the function from -π to π:
 ```
 .bark f = Sin[x];
Plot[f, {x, -Pi, Pi}]
```
