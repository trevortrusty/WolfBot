# WolfBot
I'm a discord bot that runs Mathematica/Wolfram code and sends you the result quickly!

> Currently, we are not releasing the bot invitation here yet while we are still in development, but to learn more or use WolfBot, head over to our server: [WolfBot Discord Server](https://discord.gg/eyd376A)

My four current discord commands are
- bark (***Takes in Wolfram code from you to be evaluated***)
- alpha (***Mathematica tool that queries Wolfram\|Alpha. It doesn't do everything that Wolfram\|Alpha can do, it's a very minimal feature of WolfBot***)
- help (***Sends a message regarding the bot info, and the commands listed here with their syntax***)
- docs (***Searches the Wolfram Language Documentation for you***)

## Using WolfBot
__**Bark Command**__
- Plot the graph of `E^x` from 0 to 5:
```
$bark Plot[E^x, {x, 0, 5}]
```
- Define a function `sin(x)`, then graph the function from -π to π:
 ```
 $bark f = Sin(x);
Plot[f, {x, -Pi, Pi}]
```
